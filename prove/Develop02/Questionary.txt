How are you feeling today?|What did you have for breakfast?|Did you do at least 10 min workout?|Is your day going on well?|What relevant thing happened today?|What are your goals for today?|What did you learn today from reading the scriptures?|Have you accomplish all you had to do today?|What new questions have you gotten from today's experience?|Did you do your prayers today?|Have you had any health issue today?|Who was the most interesting person I interacted with today?|What was the best part of my day?|How did I see the hand of the Lord in my life today?|What was the strongest emotion I felt today?|If I had one thing I could do over today, what would it be?
